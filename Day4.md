# Networking Basics

## 1. IP Address

**IP Address (Internet Protocol Address)** is a unique identifier assigned to each device connected to a network. It allows devices to locate and communicate with each other over the internet or a local network.

- Acts like a postal address for your computer.
- Can be **static** (permanently assigned) or **dynamic** (changes over time).

### Types of IP Addresses:
- **Private IP Address**: Used within a local network (e.g., 192.168.1.1)
- **Public IP Address**: Assigned by the ISP to access the internet
- **Static IP Address**: Manually configured, does not change
- **Dynamic IP Address**: Assigned automatically, changes periodically

---

## 2. MAC Address

**MAC (Media Access Control) Address** is a hardware identifier that is unique to each network interface card (NIC).

- Example format: `00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E`
- Assigned by the device manufacturer and hardcoded into the hardware.
- Used at the **Data Link Layer** (Layer 2) of the OSI model.
- Cannot be changed easily (though it can be spoofed in software).

---

## 3. Dynamic IP Address

A **Dynamic IP Address** is automatically assigned by a **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)** server.

- Changes each time a device connects to the network.
- Commonly used in homes and small networks.
- Reduces IP address management complexity.
- Good for general browsing, but not suitable for servers that need a consistent address.

---

## 4. IPv4

**IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4)** is the 4th version of IP and the most widely used.

- 32-bit address (e.g., `192.168.0.1`)
- Provides approximately **4.3 billion** unique addresses
- Exhaustion led to the development of IPv6
- Example:
  - Class A: `0.0.0.0 ‚Äì 127.255.255.255`
  - Class B: `128.0.0.0 ‚Äì 191.255.255.255`
  - Class C: `192.0.0.0 ‚Äì 223.255.255.255`

---

## 5. IPv6

**IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6)** is the successor to IPv4.

- 128-bit address (e.g., `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334`)
- Supports **340 undecillion (3.4√ó10¬≥‚Å∏)** addresses
- Solves address exhaustion
- Enhanced features:
  - No need for NAT (Network Address Translation)
  - Built-in security (IPSec)
  - Auto-configuration (like DHCPv6)

## 6. Types of Network Adapters

A **Network Adapter** is a hardware component that enables a device to connect to a network.

### Types:

| Adapter Type                | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Ethernet Adapter**        | Wired connection; commonly uses RJ-45 cables for LAN                        |
| **Wi-Fi Adapter**           | Wireless connection; connects to routers via radio signals                  |
| **USB Network Adapter**     | External device connected via USB port for wired/wireless connectivity      |
| **PCI Network Adapter**     | Internal card mounted on motherboard slot (usually for desktops)            |
| **Bluetooth Adapter**       | Used to connect to Bluetooth-enabled devices (short range)                  |
| **Cellular (4G/5G) Adapter**| Used in mobile broadband modems and mobile hotspots                         |
| **Virtual Network Adapter** | Created by virtual machines (e.g., VMware, VirtualBox) for virtual networking |

# üõ°Ô∏è Cyber Attack Timeline

This document outlines the typical **timeline of a cyber attack**, including the sequential phases used by attackers or penetration testers. Understanding the attack timeline is crucial for identifying, preventing, and responding to security breaches.

---

## ‚è±Ô∏è Attack Timeline Phases

### 1. üîç Reconnaissance
**Objective:** Gather information about the target.

- Identify domain names, IP addresses, subdomains
- Use OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) tools like:
  - `whois`, `nslookup`, `theHarvester`
- Passive & Active scanning

### 2. üì° Scanning
**Objective:** Identify vulnerabilities in the target systems.

- Port scanning (`nmap`)
- Service enumeration
- Vulnerability scanning (`nikto`, `OpenVAS`, `Nessus`)

### 3. üéØ Gaining Access
**Objective:** Exploit vulnerabilities to enter the system.

- Use tools like `Metasploit`, `SQLmap`, `Hydra`
- Exploitation methods:
  - Credential brute force
  - Code injection (e.g., SQLi, XSS)
  - Software bugs

### 4. üêö Privilege Escalation
**Objective:** Gain higher access rights in the system.

- Exploit kernel or local vulnerabilities
- Leverage misconfigurations or weak permissions
- Tools: `linux-exploit-suggester`, `winPEAS`, `linPEAS`

### 5. üìÇ Maintaining Access
**Objective:** Establish persistent access.

- Create backdoors or cron jobs
- Modify registry or scheduled tasks (Windows)
- Install rootkits or RATs (Remote Access Tools)

### 6. üì§ Data Exfiltration / Execution
**Objective:** Achieve the attack‚Äôs purpose.

- Steal sensitive data
- Execute ransomware or destructive payloads
- Screenshot, keylogging, database dump

### 7. üßπ Covering Tracks
**Objective:** Remove evidence of the attack.

- Clear logs (`bash_history`, Event Viewer)
- Delete tools and temporary files
- Use anti-forensics techniques

### 8. üîÅ Post-Exploitation / Pivoting
**Objective:** Move laterally to other systems.

- Enumerate internal network
- Crack hashes (e.g., `JohnTheRipper`, `hashcat`)
- Use compromised machine as a foothold
